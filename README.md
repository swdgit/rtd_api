# My Vert.x  Maven Project that will hook to the Denver RTD API

Initial project for creating a Vert.x module with a Maven build.

By default this module contains a simple Java verticle which listens on port 8080 and responds with HelloWorld

The ideal plan would be to develop a module that takes a MyStop number and gives you the next 3 busses there.
The second step would be a MyStop Number and a bus route to narrow the results.
